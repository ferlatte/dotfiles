# This incredible hack uses Apple Script to ask OmniFocus to evaluate JavaScript (ie, the JavaScript here is running inside OmniFocus).
# The JavaScript finds an existing plugin by id, finds an action within it by name, and then runs it as if you selected it from the menu.
# There is no error handling, of course.
